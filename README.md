# odin-recipies

This is one of this first projects I'm completing for the Odin Project. Looks like we are making a recipie website this time lol. Lets get at it! By the end of this project I shoukd be able to be more comfortable making basic ass websites. I'm hoping to increase my html base memory. Memorizing more tags and maybe learning some new ones.
