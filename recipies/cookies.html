    <h1>Light and Soft Peanut Butter Cookies</h1>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.media-allrecipes.com%2Fuserphotos%2F1053384.jpg&w=272&h=272&c=sc&poi=face&q=85">
    <h2>Peanut Butter and Jealous!</h2>
    <h3>When in doubt throw some peanut in there!</h3>
         <p>I never liked how peanut butter cookies turned out. They were always too greasy-feeling or too hard and never were soft a few days later. After a lot of trial and error batches, now I get rave reviews from these cookies. They are very rich and soft for those who do not like the typical crunchy style of peanut butter cookies. They do take a bit of time to prepare and cook but very much worth the wait. I used reduced-fat peanut butter in both crunchy and creamy to make for a rich-tasting cookie with more peanut flavor and a less greasy feeling on your hand.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-fat creamy peanut butter (such as Jif®)</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-fat crunchy peanut butter (such as (Jif®)</li>
            <li>1 egg white</li>
            <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, creamy peanut butter, and crunchy peanut butter together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat egg white and white sugar into butter mixture until smooth. Add whole egg and brown sugar; continue to beat until smooth. Gradually stir flour mixture into butter mixture until batter is well mixed.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into 1 1/4-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Press balls with a fork creating a crosshatch. Freeze cookie dough on baking sheet until dough is firm, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cookies puff up, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
